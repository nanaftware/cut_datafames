# cut_datafames
Script to select, process, and split Excel/CSV/JSON/PARQUET files into parts, saving them as new files.

This script has several useful applications in Data Science, especially when working with large datasets or in processes involving preparation and segmentation. Some of its main utilities are:

  Management of Large Files
 ----------------------------
Splitting for distributed processing: Allows dividing a large data file into smaller parts, making it easier to process in resource-limited systems or distributed environments like Spark or Dask.

Progressive loading: Helps load and process data in batches when the size of the entire file exceeds available RAM.

  Data Preparation
-------------------
Organization: Facilitates data segmentation for independent analysis (e.g., separating data by regions, years, or categories).

Transformation: Enables preprocessing of large datasets in smaller chunks, applying cleaning and specific transformations before integration.

   Model Training
-------------------
Batch training split: Divided datasets can be used for batch model training or for implementing techniques such as cross-validation on different subsets of data.

Efficient storage: Saving data in formats like Parquet or CSV optimizes their use in large-scale analysis platforms.

   Visualization and Analysis
-------------------------------
Segmented data exploration: By splitting the file, you can focus on more manageable subsets for visual inspection or statistical analysis.

Report generation by parts: Each package can represent an individual analysis unit, useful for generating specific visualizations or reports.

 Automation and Workflow
--------------------------
Automated pipelines: Can be integrated into automated processing pipelines to split and save data in standard formats before subsequent analysis.

Customized export: The flexibility of output formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, Excel) allows adapting to different tools and requirements.
